      <description>3.1 Random Variables Random Variable - If \(S\) is a sample space with a probability measure and \(X\) is a real-valued function defined over the elements of \(S\), then \(X\) is called a random variable
Discrete Random Variables - random variables whose range is finite or countably infinite
3.2 Probability Distributions Probability Distribution - If \(X\) is a discrete random variable, the function given by \(f(x)=P(X=x)\) for each \(x\) within the range of \(X\) is called the probability distribution of \(X\)</description>

      <description>1.2 Combinatorial Methods Theorem 1.1 [2-steps] If an operation consists of two steps, of which the first can be done in \(n_1\) ways and for each of these the second can be done in \(n_2\) ways, then the whole operation can be done in \(n_1 \cdot n_2\) ways.
Theorem 1.2 [k-steps] If an operation consists of \(k\) steps, of which the first can be done in \(n_1\) ways, for each of these the second step can be done in \(n_2\) ways, for each of the first two the third step can be done in \(n_3\) ways, and so forth, then the whole operation can be done in \(n_1 \cdot n_2 \cdot \ldots \cdot n_k\) ways.</description>

      <description>2.1 Introduction Classical Probability Concept - If there are \(N\) equally likely possibilities, of which one must occur and \(n\) are regarded as favorable, or as a “success” then the probability of a “success” is given by the ratio \(\frac{n}{N}\)
Frequency Interpretation - The probability of an event (outcome or happening) is the proportion of the time that events of the same kind will occur in the long run</description>
