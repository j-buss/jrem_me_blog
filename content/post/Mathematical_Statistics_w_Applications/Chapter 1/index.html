<h2>1.2 Combinatorial Methods</h2>
<p><strong>Theorem 1.1</strong> If an operation consists of two steps, of which the first can be done in <span class="math inline">\(n_1\)</span> ways and for each of these the second can be done in <span class="math inline">\(n_2\)</span> ways, then the whole operation can be done in <span class="math inline">\(n_1 \cdot n_2\)</span> ways.</p>
<p><strong>Theorem 1.2</strong> If an operation consists of <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> steps, of which the first can be done in <span class="math inline">\(n_1\)</span> ways, for each of these the second step can be done in <span class="math inline">\(n_2\)</span> ways, for each of the first two the third step can be done in <span class="math inline">\(n_3\)</span> ways, and so forth, then the whole operation can be done in <span class="math inline">\(n_1 \cdot n_2 \cdot \ldots \cdot n_k\)</span> ways.</p>
<p><strong>Permutations</strong> - a distinct arrangement of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> different elements of a set</p>
<p><strong>Theorem 1.3</strong> The number of permutations of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> distinct objects is <span class="math inline">\(n!\)</span></p>
<p><strong>Theorem 1.4</strong> The number of permutations of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> distinct objects taken <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> at a time is
<span class="math display">\[{}_nP_r = \frac{n!}{(n-r)!}\]</span>
for <span class="math inline">\(r=0,1,2,\ldots,n\)</span>.
<strong>Proof</strong> The formula <span class="math inline">\({}_nP_r=n(n-1) \cdot \ldots \cdot (n-r+1)\)</span> cannot be used for</p>

<h2>1.3 Binomial Coefficients</h2>
<p><strong>Theorem 1.12</strong></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\sum^k_{r=0} \dbinom m k \dbinom n {k-r} = \dbinom {m+n} k \]</span></p>
<p><strong>Proof</strong> Using the same technique as in the proof of Theorem 1.11, let us prove this theorem by equating the coefficients of <span class="math inline">\(y^k\)</span> in the expressions on both sides of the equation</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[(1+y)^{m+n}=(1+y)^m(1+y)^n\]</span></p>
<p>The coefficient of <span class="math inline">\(y^k\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\((1+y)^{m+n}\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(\dbinom {m+n} k\)</span>, and the coefficient of <span class="math inline">\(y^k\)</span> in</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[(1+y)^m(1+y)^n = \]</span></p>
